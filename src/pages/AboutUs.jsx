            <p>
                Doing nothing has always been a great passion of mine and
                I want to share my journey in becoming financial independent
                and having to do less work.
            </p>
            <p>
            My way to retire early by doing as little as possible. Sometimes slow and steady wins the race
            </p>

            <h3>Post structure</h3>
            <p>
                Simplicity, less resources spent and longterm results will be the primary focus on all my posts here.
                Time is one of the greatest resources and money is time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Improving by small margins is good enough. 0.5% better every day for a year and you are suddently more then 6 times better, 2 years 38times and 3 years 235 times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trial and error will still be posted here because I do want to share "real"
                experiences and planning. 
                Also when I do something I can't promise direct success and a lot of the time
                I have basically no idea what I am doing and by trial and error I do eventually succeed.

            <h4>Web Design</h4>
            <p>
                This website is built by me, instead of copying I thought I would learn myself to code from scratch.
                That's why my website is shitty at the moment and possibly forever. I will try to make less
                shitty websites and that's my goal. I want to learn a skill that could maybe generate money for me in the future.

            <h3>About ME and MY goals with this website</h3>
            <p>
                I want to improve my work and strategies. Learn to write better in english and motivate me to do more so I finnaly can do whatever I want for the rest of my life.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I have shared work and strategies with the public/friends before I have noticed that I get "fear of failure" and that motivates me to do better work.
            </p>

                I love to get tips on how to do stuff and will absolutely do it if I understand why it's better. 
                But mostly I do get speculative "tips" and if I can't understand why another persons way
                is better I will simply ignore it untill I do. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you tell me to go right also tell me why that is and why not left.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do love being a underdog, so won't need to be the best.
