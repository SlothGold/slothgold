                By having less then a total of 5 years working at shitty 8-5 "no education needed" job I managed to save up and start investing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Money being so scarce to me throughout my childhood I really had to constantly learn to prioritize throughout the years.
                I saved up mostly to be able to buy things that gave me long-term happiness and just having a "I can buy it but choose not to"
                felt a lot better than the other way around for me.
            </p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                The financial goal is to have as much money as possible, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Work</b> is the activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a purpose or result.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Saving</b> is the means of turning your hard earned cash into a profit and <b>investing</b> is the means of turning that cash into more cash and in turn making even more profit.
            </p>
            <p>          
                I want to achieve financial independence so the endgame for me is to have enough income to pay my living expenses for the rest of my life by myself.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Investing is the endgame in my opinion because often by investing you buy a business and in turn just receive money from it, either by dividend (direct payment) or by the increased valuation of the business over time
            </p>
            <p>
                You essentially don’t have to do anything after you bought the business. Just have to choose a good enough business and have a good plan.
                The perfect job for a sloth.

            <h4>Investing is also extremely rewarding over time.</h4>
            <br />

            <p>
                This is the formula for Compounding. Let’s say we have worked for 1 year and were able to save 12 paychecks and invested and got an annual percentage of 10% for 39 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                12*1.1^39= 493 paychecks. So just by saving 12 paychecks and not touching it for 39 years is equal to going to work for 40 years. 393/40=12.325.
            </p>
            <p>
                And we’re supposed to work for 40 years before we can retire right?
                Those numbers are not exact because they didn’t count for taxes, inflation or other costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the formula is right…. you just need the right numbers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just buying a Index Fund is the easiest to get started and doesn't need any maintenance. It’s a good measurement with investments in total.
            </p>
            <p>
                If something doesn't promise closely the return of an index fund then why bother, especially when an index fund has 0 maintenance. Imagine doing work and getting less paid than doing nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                An index is a method to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. For example <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp" target="_blank">S&P 500</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                But I choose also to try to learn stocks because I'm just like everyone else and think I can do better then the majority.
            </p>
