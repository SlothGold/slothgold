            <p>
                By having less then a total of 5 years working at shitty 8-5 "no education needed" job I managed to save up and start investing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Money being so scarce to me throughout my childhood I really had to constantly learn to prioritize throughout the years.
                I saved up mostly to be able to buy things that gave me long-term happiness and just having a "I can buy it but choose not to"
                felt a lot better than the other way around for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is what I will go over:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Saving vs investing
                </li>
                <li>
                    Saving 101
                </li>
                <li>
                    Investing
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stocks & current investment plans.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Terminate or cut down on expenses.</h3>
            <p>
                Whatever your are paying for you could always chose to not buy it.
                It's not like any of us is forced to pay for anything, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Some stuff is really hard not to pay for and some is simply not worth it.
                But we are never forced and moneys worth is relative.
                It's just a piece of paper with a number on it.
                It's worth is determined by other factors then the material value.
            </p>

            <h4>Money's worth</h4>
            <p>
                It's about the demand. 
                Create enough hunger and everyone becomes a criminal. 
                Desperation I believe is a one of the things to be a big factor for demand.
                Create enough need for money and soon you will do petty crimes for change instead of thinking of a more long term solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lower the demand, lower the price. Get out of hunger and start planting seeds and in the future 
                you will have a farm and never have to worry about hunger again, or at least worry about it less. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Terminate as much as possible to kill the desperation and focus on the things that has a monthly cost because they will add up.
                Things that gives a short term gratification is also bad because they also add up big time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expenses I don't want to completely terminate I try to cut down, little by little. Don't need massive savings in one area right away but it
                sure does help if you can cut it down.
            </p>

            <h3>How got I better and better at saving.</h3>
            <p>
                I made
                <a href="" target="_blank"> my own budget </a>
                and try to play around with it. There are plenty of
                <a href="https://blog.risecredit.com/17-free-google-sheets-budget-templates/" target="_blank"> other budgets </a>
                 out there if your looking for something else. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I also made potential loss/wins so you could see how much you are likely to gain in the long term by savings your doing now.
                All to motivate myself to keep improving.

                Pie charts are the awesome for budgets, love the simplicity.

            <h4>How I got started Investing and have learned.</h4>
            <p>
                Since I was a youngling I always loved games with some sort of economic, I wouldn't always be the best but if the games continued
                for a long time I sure as hell would be richest and/or have the late-game advantage
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I first got introduced to stocks I instantly fell in love.
                I couldn't believe that you could buy as much as you want since most games have some sort of cap
            </p>
